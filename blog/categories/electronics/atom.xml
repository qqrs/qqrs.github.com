    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="softpot">SoftPot?</h3>
<p><img class="right" src="/images/softpot<em>200px</em>01.jpg" title="‘SoftPot’" ></p>

<p>The SoftPot is a touch–sensitive position sensor produced by <a href="http://www.spectrasymbol.com/potentiometer/softpot">Spectra Symbol</a>.
It is available in a variety of sizes and configurations for linear and angular position measurements.
There are also two related product lines: the ThinPot, which is narrower, and the HotPot, which is rated for higher temperature operation.</p>

<p>A SoftPot acts as a momentary–contact potentiometer. 
When a finger or mechanical stylus presses down on the sensor area, a top conductive shunt layer makes contact with a lower resistive layer.
The top layer serves the same purpose as a movable wiper in a traditional rotary potentiometer, dividing the resistive layer into two segments around the point of contact. </p>

<p>More detail on the SoftPot can be found at the <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/sensors/Reports/SoftPot">NYU ITP Sensor Workshop</a>
(update 1/2/2015: unfortunately the page seems to have been removed and is not available from web.archive.org).</p>

<p>Several vendors sell the SoftPot in small quantities, including <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com">SparkFun</a>, <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/">Adafruit</a>, and <a href="http://www.digikey.com/">Digikey</a>.</p>

<p>While reading up on the SoftPot to prepare for using it in a project, I found that a number of people posting in the SparkFun comments had run into problems
since the datasheet is pretty sparse and there are few other resources available.
It’s a pretty handy sensor for certain applications and it would be a shame to see people avoiding it due to the limited documentation.</p>

<h3 id="interfacing-a-softpot">Interfacing a SoftPot</h3>
<p><img class="right" src="/images/softpot_pot_divider.png" title="‘Potentiometer voltage divider’" >
The SoftPot datasheet indicates that it can be interfaced in the same way as a traditional rotary potentiometer.
There are two bus bar pins, which are connected to power (pin 1) and ground (pin 3). 
The datasheet refers to pin 2 as the “collector,” which is analogous to the wiper in a rotary potentiometer.
With power and ground connected, the collector voltage is proportional to the position of the touch along the length of the SoftPot.</p>

<p>This configuration works fine as long as the SoftPot is always activated by a touch.
However, it is not immediately clear from the datasheet how the sensor responds when not touched.</p>

<p>I connected my SoftPot (part number SP-L-0300-103-1%-RH) to the ADC input of a microcontroller and found that the ADC recorded a slow oscillation of a few hundred millivolts when the SoftPot was not touched.
This seemed to indicate that the SoftPot leaves the collector floating when not touched, so I took some resistance measurements.</p>

<p><br />
That confirmed it. The collector pin is floating when the sensor is not touched.</p>

<p>Also worth noting is that the resistance from pin 1 to 3 decreases slightly when the SoftPot is touched. When touching with a fingernail instead of a fingertip, 
the resistance decrease is smaller, 
so this effect seems to be caused by the conductive shunt layer shorting out a cross section of the resistive layer at the point of contact.</p>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> By pressing both ends of the SoftPot at the same time it is possible to short power to ground, which can damage the SoftPot. 
This may be unlikely with the linear SoftPot, but is a serious concern for the rotary SoftPot since a stray finger could easily press both ends at the same time.
A resistor in series with the supply pin should protect against this, but will reduce the voltage range of the output.</p>

<h3 id="softpot-with-pulldown">SoftPot with Pulldown</h3>
<p><img class="right" src="/images/softpot_pot_divider_pulldown.png" title="‘Potentiometer voltage divider with pulldown’" ></p>

<p>We need a way to distinguish between a garbage sensor measurement due to the floating collector pin and a good sensor measurement resulting from a touch.
One way to do so is to add a pulldown resistor at the SoftPot collector pin that will hold the ADC input at GND when the SoftPot is not touched.</p>

<p>Adding a pulldown resistor will affect the linearity of the sensor measurement.
The choice of resistance value is a tradeoff: 
it must be small enough to hold the ADC pin near GND but as large as possible to reduce the linearity error introduced in the measurement.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/softpot_res_divider_pulldown.png" title="‘Softpot equivalent circuit with pulldown’" >
The SoftPot can be modeled as two series resistors, 
<script type="math/tex"> R_1 </script> and <script type="math/tex"> R_2 </script>, where  <script type="math/tex"> R_1 + R_2 = 10kΩ </script>.
The touch position can be denoted as <script type="math/tex"> x </script>, with <script type="math/tex"> x = 0.0 </script> corresponding to the close end of the sensor and <script type="math/tex"> x = 1.0 </script> to the far end.
Since the resistances are proportional to touch position, this gives <script type="math/tex"> R_1 = x \cdot 10kΩ </script> and <script type="math/tex"> R_2 = (1-x) \cdot 10kΩ </script>.</p>

<p>When a pulldown resistor <script type="math/tex"> R_o </script> is added, it combines in parallel with <script type="math/tex"> R_1 </script> 
and the voltage at the ADC input can be calculated as 
<script type="math/tex"> V_{out} = \frac{R_1 \| R_o}{(R_1 \| R_o) + R_2}\cdot{V_{cc}} </script>,
where <script type="math/tex"> R_1 \| R_o = (\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_o})^{-1} </script>.</p>

<p>To illustrate the effect of the pulldown resistor on sensor linearity, 
the top plot below shows <script type="math/tex"> \frac{V_{out}}{V_{cc}} </script> vs. touch position for four values of <script type="math/tex"> R_o </script>: 1 kΩ, 10 kΩ, 100 kΩ, and 1 MΩ.
The bottom plot shows linearity error, which is the percentage difference from a true linear response due to the effect of the pulldown resistor.
(Python/matplotlib source code <a href="http://gist.github.com/qqrs/4107845">here</a>).</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/softpot_pulldown_error_sm.png" title="‘SoftPot Pulldown Error’" ></p>

<p>The following table shows the maximum linearity error for each pulldown resistance value. </p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: right"><script type="math/tex"> R_o </script></th>

<p><br />
A good rule of thumb for most circuits is to choose a pulldown resistor an order of magnitude larger than the output resistance of the signal source.
It seems to hold in this case:
any value that is at least 100 kΩ is reasonable, depending on the specifics of the application.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>The SoftPot can be treated like a traditional rotary potentiometer, except when the sensor is not touched. 
When not touched, the sensor output at the collector pin is left floating.
Taking this into account, here are three possibilities for using the sensor:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Add a pulldown resistor of approximately 100kΩ – 1MΩ to hold the sensor output at GND when not touched.</li>
  <li>Design the device such that a stylus or other object is in continuous mechanical contact with the SoftPot.</li>
  <li>Use some additional means of detecting touch events, such as a limit switch or capacitive touch sensor. Only read the SoftPot output when a touch has been detected.</li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, this may not apply to most applications, but if there is a possibility the SoftPot could be touched simultaneously at both ends for an extended period of time
it should be protected with a supply–pin series resistor or other current–limiting circuit.</p>

<p>That’s it. The SoftPot is a useful sensor with many possibilities for interesting projects!</p>

    <updated>2013-04-10T12:59:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://qqrs.github.com/blog/2013/04/10/twilio-light-sensor</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a quick project created in collaboration with <a href="http://twitter.com/leocadiotine">@leocadiotine</a>
at <a href="http://www.hackerschool.com">Hacker School</a>. Hacker School is a free three–month self–directed learning environment
that has been described as being “like a writers’ retreat for programmers.”</p>

<p>Thanks go to <a href="http://twitter.com/sashalaundy">@sashalaundy</a> for the introduction to the Twilio API that sparked the idea.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/twilio_light_sensor_text_message.png" title="‘Text message response’" >
The Hacker School space for our batch had two restrooms: one attached to the main work area, and one downstairs. 
We thought it would nice to know if the bathroom is occupied before taking the time to walk down.</p>

<p>Our project makes it possible to check the bathroom status by phone or text message.</p>

<p>Bathroom occupancy status is determined using a light sensor attached to a Raspberry Pi. 
If the lights are on in the bathroom, we assume that the bathroom is occupied.</p>

<p>We created a Heroku–hosted web application that accepts periodic bathroom state updates from the Raspberry Pi and handles incoming requests from Twilio. 
When a user calls or texts the Twilio phone number, Twilio sends a request to the web app, which responds with an appropriate message to be spoken or texted to the user.</p>

<p>In addition to the voice/SMS interface, <a href="http://twitter.com/gelstudios">@gelstudios</a> created a nice web interface for the project.</p>

<h2 id="server">Server</h2>

<h3 id="twilio">Twilio</h3>
<p>Twilio is a web–based service for sending and receiving phone calls and SMS text messages.
It provides an easy–to–use API accessible via HTTP and a convenient Python package.
A free trial of the service is available (which inserts small nag notices into outgoing messages).
We used the <a href="http://www.twilio.com/docs/quickstart/python">Twilio Python Quickstart Tutorials</a> as our introduction.</p>

<h3 id="heroku">Heroku</h3>
<p>Heroku is a service that provides a complete, integrated stack for hosting web applications with a range of choices in language, framework, web server and data store.
We created the server application for the project in Python using the Flask microframework. 
The Heroku Dev Center article <a href="http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python">Getting Started with Python on Heroku</a> is a good walkthrough for setting up Flask on Heroku.</p>

<h3 id="server-code">Server Code</h3>
<p>Full source for the web application can be found at <a href="https://github.com/qqrs/twilio-light-sensor-server/blob/master/run.py">github.com/qqrs/twilio-light-sensor-server/blob/master/run.py</a>.</p>

<p>The <code>/twilio/voice</code> and <code>/twilio/text</code> routes handle requests from Twilio. 
When a user calls or sends an SMS message to the phone number assigned to our account, Twilio is configured so that it will make an HTTP POST request to these routes.
When the server receives the request from Twilio, it generates an appropriate message indicating the status of the bathroom. 
The message is returned to Twilio in the HTTP response and is sent to the user as either audio (by text–to–speech) or as an SMS message.</p>

<p>The <code>/update</code> route accepts sensor state updates from the remote sensor via HTTP POST. 
Each request includes <code>sensor_id</code> and <code>sensor_val</code> parameters to identify
the sensor and report the current value. </p>

<h3 id="raspberry-pi">Raspberry Pi</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> is a single–board computer with an ARM–core processor, SD card slot, HDMI and composite video, USB, and optional Ethernet
that is able to run a full distribution of Linux.
Though similar ARM dev boards and single–board computers have
<a href="http://beagleboard.org/">existed</a>
for <a href="http://www.embeddedarm.com/products/arm-sbc.php">years</a>,
the Raspberry Pi was able to hit an enticing price point of $35 (with Ethernet) while still including many of the attractive features of more expensive boards.</p>

<p>A 5V USB power supply and an SD card with an operating system installed are required to begin using the Raspberry Pi. 
A good guide to getting started can be found at the <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Beginners">elinux.org wiki</a>.
Preloaded SD cards can be purchased from several vendors or an operating system image can be <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup">loaded onto a blank SD card</a>.</p>

<p>Note that it is important to have a stable power supply. Some USB 5V supplies may be inadequate. 
I experienced SD card corruption several times until I bought a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008R97TOQ">good supply</a> 
and set <code>over_voltage=2</code> in the config.txt file as described <a href="http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/2069/filesystem-corruption-on-the-sd-card">here</a>.
Any good supply with at least a 1.0 amp current rating should be acceptable.</p>

<p><a href="/images/twilio_light_sensor_photocell_sch.jpg"><img class="right" src="/images/twilio_light_sensor_photocell_sch.jpg" width="139" title="Photocell schematic" ></a></p>

<h3 id="light-sensor">Light Sensor</h3>
<p>The light sensor is a 10k CdS photocell, interfaced to a Raspberry Pi with an analog–to–digital converter (ADC) daughterboard. The light sensor is connected to an input of the ADC in a voltage divider configuration with a 10k resistor. With illumination from overhead lighting, the resistance of the photocell drops to about 1.5k.</p>

<h3 id="adc-daughterboard">ADC Daughterboard</h3>
<p><img class="right" src="/images/twilio_light_sensor_adc_daughterboard.jpg" title="ADC daughterboard" >
An analog–to–digital converter (ADC) is required to read the signal from the light sensor. 
The Raspberry Pi does not have an integrated ADC like the Arduino and many microcontroller dev boards. 
However, it is straightforward to interface an external ADC via the SPI or I²C buses. 
Adafruit provides a good guide to using the Microchip MCP3008: 
<a href="http://learn.adafruit.com/reading-a-analog-in-and-controlling-audio-volume-with-the-raspberry-pi/overview">Analog Inputs for Raspberry Pi Using the MCP3008</a>.</p>

<p>I had soldered up an MCP3008 on protoboard for another project so I reused it for this project.</p>

<p>A number of assembled <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Expansion_Boards">expansion boards</a> that provide an ADC are available from third–party vendors.</p>

<h3 id="raspberry-pi-remote-sensor-monitoring-script">Raspberry Pi Remote Sensor Monitoring Script</h3>
<p>Adafruit provides <a href="http://learn.adafruit.com/reading-a-analog-in-and-controlling-audio-volume-with-the-raspberry-pi/script">sample code</a> 
in Python to read from the ADC via the SPI bus.</p>

<p>Full source for the remote sensor monitoring script can be found at <a href="https://github.com/qqrs/twilio-light-sensor-remote/blob/master/twilio_light_sensor.py">github.com/qqrs/twilio-light-sensor-remote/blob/master/twilio_light_sensor.py</a>.</p>

<p>The monitoring script consists of a polling loop that reads the sensor at a defined interval. 
It calls <code>readadc()</code>, a function provided by Adafruit that bit–bangs the SPI communication in software (some versions of the Raspberry Pi did not include hardware SPI).
Sensor state is determined by comparing the ADC value to a fixed threshold: if greater than the threshold, the light is assumed to be on.
A moving average is used as a basic low–pass filter to prevent a noisy read from being interpreted as a change in state. 
The sensor state is reported to the server via an HTTP POST request by <code>update_server_state()</code> whenever the sensor state changes, or at least every 60 seconds when it has not changed.</p>

<p>To run the script, Python packages must be installed. See the Adafruit article
<a href="http://learn.adafruit.com/reading-a-analog-in-and-controlling-audio-volume-with-the-raspberry-pi/necessary-packages">here</a>
on installing <code>python-dev</code> and <code>rpi.gpio</code>.
The script can be run at the terminal: <code>python twilio_light_sensor.py</code>. </p>

<p>To run the script automatically at boot, it can be added to the end of <code>/etc/rc.local</code>, 
immediately before the <code>exit 0</code> line:
<code>python /home/pi/twilio_light_sensor/twilio_light_sensor.py &amp;</code>
(modifying the path to script if necessary). </p>

<p>Note that the trailing ampersand <code>&amp;</code> is required. This forks a subshell and allows the rest of the init sequence to complete.
The script can be stopped by switching to another tty with Ctrl–Alt–F2, logging in, finding the process ID with <code>ps aux | grep twilio</code>, and killing the process with <code>kill &lt;pid&gt;</code>.</p>

<h2 id="success">Success</h2>
<p>With the server running on Heroku and the light sensor attached to the Raspberry Pi, Twilio responds to text messages or voice calls: <code>The bathroom is vacant</code> or <code>The bathroom is occupied</code>. Success!</p>
